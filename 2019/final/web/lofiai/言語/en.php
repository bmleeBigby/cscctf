    I’ll love you more tomorrow than today
    These overflowing emotions won’t stop
    Right now even though I love you so much
    I can’t put it into words

    The days you’ve given me accumulate
    The days that have passed, the paths we walked together
    Whether our meeting was coincidence
    Or fate, just the fact that I met you
    Is a miracle

    We walk close together
    Making our eternal love tangible
    I want to always be smiling by your side
    “Thank you” and, ah, “I love you”
    Just aren’t enough, just at least let me say
    I’m happy

    Just having your right hand
    Softly wrapped up
    In my left hand
    Made me feel your love

    We found the little happinesses in each day
    In the slow path we walked
    Our meeting is just one small thing
    In a big world, but just the fact that we met
    Is a miracle

    Even on days when nothing goes well
    Just being together cheers me up
    Bravado and loneliness fade away
    When I’m with you, lala, I can be myself
    Just stay with me forever
    My beloved

    When we fooled around on the way home
    That was one of our precious days, too
    And when I finally got up the courage to tell you how I felt
    The expression on your face was one I’d never seen before
    There was a pause, and then you nodded
    Our hearts are filled with love
    We’re still on our journey
    Towards the future that will hopefully continue
    For dozens of years

    Even if we lose sight
    Of tomorrow

    We walk close together
    Making our eternal love tangible
    I want to always be smiling by your side
    “Thank you” and, ah, “I love you”
    Just aren’t enough, just at least let me say
    I’m happy

    Even on days when nothing goes well
    Just being together cheers me up
    Our happiness and sadness is all shared
    Because you're here I can keep going
    Just stay with me forever
    My beloved
    Until the final second

    I’ll be smiling more tomorrow than today
    Just being with you makes me feel that way
    Ten of years, hundreds of years, thousands of years
    Let's surpass time, I love you
